# number_guesser

See the deployed version at https://kathleenyruegas.github.io/number_guesser/

The focus of this project was to practice manipulating the DOM with JavaScript and JQuery to build a dynamic number guesser game. Also worked on the CSS to match a given wireframe markup.

Through the first iteration of building this project, I selected my own random number between 1 and 100 and had the user guess. On the second iteration, I allowed the guessing range to be more dynamic by adding user input fields for determining the minimum and maximum numbers of that range.
